vida-0.8devel: (middle of June 2003):
  - Finally has been added DNS Spoofing support. This is in BETA. 
  - Code cleaned
  - Add some english comment. It so much remains job to make.
  - Info() has been changed
  - indent use -kr flags but Embyte prefers jed :-)
  - Changed mvwaddstr with mvwprintw
  
vida-0.7.1:
  - Vida can now print packages that matched a given string (grep over
    TCP payload)
  - I have arranged manpage
  
vida-0.7:
  - datapipe password support - now you can use vida as an autenticated
    wingate, bouncer or proxy to hide your IP. I haven't implemented a 
    multy-account system but only a single password autentication which is much
    sufficient for a datapipe 
  - README file has being written (I think lesion has just included it the
    0.6 package, but it will be insert officialy from this release on)
  - correct some mini-bug
    
vida-0.6:
  - added file-logging support (use 'l' on the choosed connection to
    enable and disable) (vida creates a file IPrequest-IPbounced:PORT).
  - man page completed
  - vida is now on freshmeat.net
    (http://freshmeat.net/projects/vida/?topic_id=152%2C150%2C43)
  - has being insered a pseudo LICENSE file

vida-0.5 (a month later...):
  - I've changed (a few) the header files setup and reversed the history file
    (last modifies before) now named CHANGELOG;
  - there's a sketch of site ripped from paranoy (index.php);
  - the Makefile is filled :). "make" to compile, "make install"
    and "uninstall" are ok, and there's also "make indent" to indent the code
  - if a connection happens meanwhile the connection list is open it will be refreshed
    instantly
  - now the update of the amount of sent/received data is for all the connections
    and not only for the selected one :)
  - fixed some bugs of displaying in datapipe()
  - the printing in wdata now works!! there are 4 switchable modes pressing
    enter on the chose connection or with special keys.
    The first prints incoming data from the client, the second one prints
    the incoming data from server, the third mode prints both, and the fourth
    mode is the same as the third except it changes the colour for each provenience.
    Every mode change is evidenced in wdata.
    Mode 1 can be selected with 'c' (client) key, mode 2 with 's' (server),
    mode 3 uses 'b' (both) key and mode 4 with 'k' (c letter was busy and
    hence kolor (such as pine :) ))
  - when I pick out a connection to bring it in 'sniffing' mode, the status flags
    of the other are zeroed with statzero().
  - some variables changes for the simple hijacking
  - sourceforge registration requested
  - sketch of man page
  - "make install" install also man pages

vida-0.4:
  I've added "simple hijacking" feature allowing, with the 'j' key press on the
  selected connection, to send a data string straight to either a direction or the
  other (simple implementation...but very interesting for studying how the nets work
  and also for ludus. (irc hijacking :pP)).
  - the "help" item shows the HELP file scrollable up and down (ripped and fitted
    from paranox.sourceforge.net)
  - i've added the banner onto each source.
  - i've written (all alone) this HISTORY that it will evolve in a much schematic
    way.


vida-0.3:
  Starting with this release vida is divided in separate files for a better maintenance
  and optimisation of the code (to compile simply type make, all is going to be read
  from the Makefile). lesion has fixed some bugs related to the delete of the connections,
  and moreover:
  - lesion is working to add the dns request interception to spoofing them and
    redirect the traffic throughout vida. (one part of the code was ripped
    (see dnshijacking.c))
  - I think that the vida's project web site is up and running on sourceforge (it will
    be available also on freshmeat)


vida-0.2.3:
  A lot of bugs were fixed and some pretty features were added or improved:
  - deleting of connections or datapipes (available with 'canc' or 'd' key)
    is now almost perfect; there is only a problem in the accept() of datapipe()
    during the pthread_cancel() function call). The thread ain't be deleted and
    the bound port remains in listen mode.
  - It's possible to print and sniff the traffic throughout the datapipe and
    in the selected connection (with the 'enter' key) (this feature was removed
    between 0.2 and 0.2.3 releases). However there is basically a problem: it works
    only under X and hence vida lose a big slice of its charming, thus we decided
    to remove this feature (available only in the 0.2.3 release) in the following
    versions until the release of a full working one. (lesion is thinking about the
    raw use of the terminal from LINES/2 to the bottom).
  - Near each datatipe you can see in real time the number of the connections that it's
    going to handle
  - Near each connection (in the datapipe's menu) is it possible to see in real time the
    amount of transferred bytes (in both directions)
    [remember that a single word like 'user(enter)' takes 5/6 bytes (4 of user +
    1 for the \n and another 1 for the \r if the client is, for example, telnet)].



vida-0.2:
  At this time lesion join the game. He improves very much the vida project.
  A lot of send-and-receive (code and emails) between us allow the birth the
  0.2 release, totally rewritten using the ncurses library (from its man page:
  CRT screen handling and optimisation package). Vida now supports more datapipes
  at the same time and as before a lot of connections for each (It was developed
  with the aid of two nested threads, the outer one handles the datapipes (see
  datapipe() func.) and the inner one routes the whole traffic to the single
  connections (see handler() func.).


vida-0.1:
  I've fixed to things:
  - Now the connection is bi-directional (I check both the socket descriptors
    with a polling select() and hence I send to the right or the left).
  - The datapipe support a lot of connections at the same time (the main function
    creates the socket descriptor in listening mode and accepts the requests;
    the it "forkes" itself and let the datapipe handling to the ncnt
    function).
   

vida-0.0 (middle of June 2002):
  The first working release. In the beginning, the name of the whole
  project was "datapipe". As you could read in the first line of the
  source file, my starting aim was to develop a simple datapipe for
  my own home-LAN. The only 0.0 release functionality was to route the
  incoming packets on the specified port (argv[1]) to the host
  argv[2]:argv[3] (I didn't write the reply-data routine and
  hence the connection was totally monodirectional). There also was
  support for file logging since the source was initially ripped from
  another source that will evolve into an absurd code named ss (??)
  (now is also pretty :P)
